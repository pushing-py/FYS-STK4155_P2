Software requirements

All code in this project was written in Python 3.10. The experiments rely on standard scientific computing libraries. The following external Python packages were used:
- numpy and pandas for numerical computation and data handling
- matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation
- scikit-learn for data splitting and general utility functions
- tqdm for progress bar visualisation during training loops
- scikit-plot for plotting classification metrics (e.g. confusion matrices)
- torch for building and training neural networks
- six.moves.urllib for downloading the Quick, Draw! data using the API script
